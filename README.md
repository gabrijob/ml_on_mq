This repository contains:
- ./
L-- A3C/ 		distributed reinforcement learning solution source code
L-- SAQN/ 		deep-q-learning solution source code
L-- ML_MODULE 	library and API to facilitate usage of ML solutions with SparkMQ
L-- MQ_FILES		files to be added to the original MQ file tree to enable the usage of the API (to be removed eventually)
